LARGE_PARAGRAPH = """I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid
writing programs in Basic. That language didn't even support recursion. It's
hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but I didn't miss it
at the time. I thought in Basic. And I was a whiz at it.
Master of all I surveyed. - Paul Graham

A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing
programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.
- Paul Graham

A recursive definition does not necessarily lead to a recursive process.
